Summary: 
This figure shows how views on moral questions depend on where you live. The data shown here provides survey responses of different countries for the following three questions on marriage:

"Do you think ...

1) extramaritial affairs 
2) divorce 3) 
premaritial sex

... are/is morally

1) acceptable 
2) not acceptable or 
3) not a moral issue?"

Design: 

To demonstrate the dependence on the country of origin the data is shown on a map. As the responses are given in percentages (limited by 100%), I used stacked bars and traffic ligt like colors to visualize the different proportions.
